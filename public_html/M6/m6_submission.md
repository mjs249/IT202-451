<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>mjs249 7/3/23 <br>When the &quot;Start Game&quot; button is clicked (onclick=&quot;startGame()&quot;), the startGame() function<br>is executed. This function disables the button, starts a countdown timer, and focuses<br>the canvas. In the game loop, if the game has started, the game<br>logic is executed, including updating positions, checking collisions and scores, and drawing elements.<br>If the countdown is still running, the countdown number is displayed before each<br>iteration of the game loop.<br></p>

<tr><td> <em>Caption:</em> <p>mjs249 7/3/23  <br>The game score is tracked using the variables leftScore and<br>rightScore. Each time the ball passes a paddle, the corresponding player&#39;s score is<br>incremented. The checkScore() function checks if a player has reached the minimum winning<br>score and a lead of at least 2 points. If so, it stops<br>the game loop and displays a winner popup.<br><br>The reset button calls the resetGame()<br>function, which resets the scores, ball, paddles, and clears the canvas. It restarts<br>the game loop and enables the &quot;Start Game&quot; button, allowing the game to<br>be played again from the beginning.<br></p>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>During this assignment, I learned about the basics of creating a Pong game<br>using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. I gained a better understanding of how to<br>handle keyboard input, update game elements, detect collisions, and track scores. I also<br>explored concepts like timers, intervals, and focusing elements. The related HTML5 Canvas readings<br>provided valuable insights into the fundamentals of drawing and animating graphics on the<br>canvas. I learned about the Canvas API, drawing shapes, applying styles, and managing<br>animations. These readings helped me grasp the underlying concepts and techniques necessary for<br>building interactive games and visual applications using the HTML5 Canvas element.<br></div><br></td></tr>
